Project is about:

Using word2vec to encode sentences into index which refers to the nth frequency in corpus. 

Ths corpus is constructed based on training and test data. 

Then apply bidirectional LSTM to train on training data. 

The best model is saved with the highest validaiton accuracy. 

Make prediction on test data based on this model.
